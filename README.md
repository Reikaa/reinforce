#### A Playground for Reinforcement Learning

_an exploration of research areas in reinforcement learning, with a particular focus on cross-domain transfer learning_   

Up to now, most of what you'll find here focuses on the following:   
- using the OpenAI Gym to emulate game environments (e.g. cartpole and ping pong)
- using native RL methods and policy gradients.

with the following being in a separate repo [here](https://github.com/dorajam/gridworld_RL/tree/master):
- value iteration and q learning algorithms for the gridworld problem
- here is a fun snapshot:
